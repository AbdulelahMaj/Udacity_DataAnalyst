## Dataset

> This [data set](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/prosperLoanData.csv&sa=D&ust=1547699802003000)
contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, 
borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.
This [data dictionary](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gDyi_L4UvIrLTEC6Wri5nbaMmkGmLQBk-Yx3z0XDEtI/edit?usp=sharing) explains the 
variables in the data set.

> The project objective is not expected to explore all of the features in the dataset! But focus on only exploration on about 10 or 15 of them.

## Summary of Findings

> LoanStatus of all Borrowers are with current and complete state.

> EmploymentStatus for most of the Borrowers are employed state.

> Most of the loan applicants are from 25,000 to 75,000 with emloyed status.

> Most of the occupation are Professional and computer programmers and others.

> half of the applicants are home owners.

> Homeowners borrowers are more likely to have a larger loan amount. 

> Most borrowers can have less than 5,000, whatever their employment status was. On the other hand, borrowers who are employed or self-employed are able to have loans higher than 10,000. 

> I observe that borrowers who are employed whether having a home to own or not can have higher loan amount and lower APR. And borrowers who are employed and aren’t have a home to own can also have a higher loan amount but alsothey need to pay higher APR.
